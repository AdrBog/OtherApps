# 2 - User Interface

## 2.1 Main Page

After starting OtherApps and accessing the page, the application should look similar to the image below:
<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/imgs/img1.png">
</div>

This is the main page of OtherApps, where you will see a list of all the applications you have created. As you have not created any yet, the list is empty.

To create an application, click on "New App".

A window will appear in which you can enter the name of the application, make sure that it does not have spaces or special characters, or that there is no application with that name already existing.
<div align="center">

</div>

Once you click on "Create", a folder will be created in the "projects_dir" directory. That is why I recommend not to use spaces or special characters.

The page will refresh and your application will appear in the list, the folder will also appear in your "projects_dir" directory.

## 2.2 Player
To play the application, click on the link with the name of your project.
<div align="center">

Since you have not yet edited your project, the application will be empty.
