Use Other Apps to create simple apps for small and resource-poor businesses

## Why Other Apps instead of Power Apps
0. **Other Apps is free and open source**, making it perfect for developers to customize the application to their own liking.
1. **Other Apps makes 0 connections to the internet**, unless you tell it to make a connection of course.
2. **Self-Hosting**, once you download Other Apps, it's yours to do whatever you want
3. **No dependencies**, Other Apps works with pure javascript. No npm, nodejs, jsquery ... needed
4. **IT'S FREE**

Disclaimer! Other Apps is still under development. And it is focused for small business/local networks. I do not recommend using it for large enterprises.
