# Other Apps

[![GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v3-blue)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

Lightweight Free and Open Source alternative to Microsoft's Power Apps written in Python and Flask.

## Why use Other Apps instead of Power Apps
0. **Other Apps is free and open source**, making it perfect for developers to customize the application to their own liking.
1. **Other Apps makes 0 connections to the internet**, this makes it more private and secure.
2. **Self-Hosting**
3. **Easy setup**, Other Apps works  with pure javascript. No npm, nodejs, jsquery, etc needed.

Disclaimer! Other Apps is still under development. And it is focused for small business/local networks. I do not recommend using it for large enterprises.

## Help

## The future of Other Apps
Personally I am very happy with the result, I use Other Apps in a non-ironic way to help my father with his projects. I'm going to try to separate the database manager from Other Apps and create a new project, maybe Other Lists.
