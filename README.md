# Other Apps

[![GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GNU%20v3-blue)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

Lightweight Free and Open Source alternative to Microsoft's Power Apps written in Python and Flask.

Other Apps works with Javascript and HTML (Instead of that strange language that Power Apps uses), this allows you to do everything you could do in javascript, without limitations.

Disclaimer! Other Apps is still under development. And it is focused for small business/local networks. I do not recommend using it for large enterprises.
